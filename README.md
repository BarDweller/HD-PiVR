HD-PiVR
=======

A simple tool to record video using a Hauppauge HD PVR and a Raspberry Pi

The HD PVR is a USB based recording device that has Linux drivers, and can be used with a PC or a Raspberry Pi, to record video/audio as h264/aac/ac3 .ts files to disk.

This project is attempting to build a simple PVR, with a web interface to allow scheduling of recordings, with the eventual goal of having the Pi + HDPVR run as a diskless unattended recording solution, able to harvest TV content while you sleep/work.
